# secret-encoder-decoder
This is a demo of an encoder and a decoder of secret. The encoder transforms text data into a binary file, and the decoder reverses it.

It is based on the Random module of python, and should not be used to protect actual secret.

"Warning The pseudo-random generators of this module should not be used for security purposes. For security or cryptographic uses, see the secrets module." -- Python documentation

Please see https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html for more information.
